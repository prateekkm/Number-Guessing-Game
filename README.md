# Number Guessing Game
 I developed a C++ code for a number guessing game.
 It allows a player to deposit balance amount to start playing.
 Then the player can select the bet amount before each round.
 Next the player can select any number in the given range [1,7].
 In each round, a winning number lying in the range [1,7] is selected by a random number generator.
 If the guessed number matches with the winning number, the player wins 7 times the bet amount.
 Else, he loses the bet amount.
 If the remaining balance is not zero, the player is allowed to play another round.
 Else, the game ends.
