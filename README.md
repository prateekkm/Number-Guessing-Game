# Number Guessing Game
 I developed a C++ code for a number guessing game.<br />
 It allows a player to deposit balance amount to start playing.<br />
 Then the player can select the bet amount before each round.<br />
 Next the player can select any number in the given range [1,7].<br />
 In each round, a winning number lying in the range [1,7] is selected by a random number generator.<br />
 If the guessed number matches with the winning number, the player wins 7 times the bet amount.<br />
 Else, he loses the bet amount.<br />
 If the remaining balance is not zero, the player is allowed to play another round.<br />
 Else, the game ends.<br />
